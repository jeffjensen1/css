Let me introduce myself first.

Hi I am Jeff, if you want to read more about my goals, experiences and what I am doing with my life then go visit my about me page. Here I will just give you a quick introduction about my interests. I enjoy long boarding, fishing, hunting and nearly anything outdoors. Fishing has been a big part of my life since my dad taught all my brothers and I how to fish at a young age. I also have been into Motocross for a very long time. Honestly, I got a dirt bike before I got a bicycle, yes that dirt bike had training wheels but it was still a dirt bike. I also enjoy playing video games, below is the logo for my gaming channel on YouTube and the channel for Twitch Streaming.</h2>
