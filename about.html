	<h4>Although I only have my life set up into only a few priorities I still find myself busy and very immersed in everything I do. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Gaming Interactive Media Mobile at Boise State University. This degree will set me up and allow me to jump into a different amount of fields from a Mobile Application Developer, Video Game Designer and even Web Developer. I already have a few degrees in the computer hardware aspect, Associates of Science in Information Technology, a few Technical Certificates, and CompTia Networking + and A+ Certifications.

I have a few goals, long term and short. Of course the most important is finish college and land a job inside the programming field would be great. More short end goal would be to always make sure I learn something new about programming. Even if its a small order, just make sure it is something..</h4>
